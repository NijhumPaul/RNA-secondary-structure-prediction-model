This is a web based online tool, where you can find the protein secondary structure information given a accession ID or a list of accession ID.
I have measured parameters like Betasheet percentage, known partial percentage, Helix percentage, Known partial helix percentage, Random coil percentage, Known partial random coil percentage of Protein IDs that are extracted from Uniprot database. The output will result in a .csv file. I also Performed error handling and logging the errors in a .txt file.
I also contributed to website designing.
